# Edge-Detection
Built a program to detect edges in an image using the properties of high and low-pass filters, 2D convolutions, Gaussian kernels, Fourier transforms, etc. The novel part about this project was that we did not use the built-in OpenCV library functions, we implemented the whole program ourselves, from scratch.
